# digi-groove-teensy-button
This is the code for the Digi-Groove controller.

The project's inspiration came from a rhythm game arcade cabinet of the same name.
I saw it, loved it, and then built two like it from scratch.
I couldn't have done it without the help of two very skilled and great friends.
We constructed a 4-panel and 5-panel Digi-Groove controller.
Both controllers were designed to be portable and played with one or two players per controller.

Currently, I enjoy playing games like Stepmania and Crypt of the Necrodancer.
